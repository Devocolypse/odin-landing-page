# God of War Fan Page

A simple project showcasing one of my favorite games: **God of War (2018)** and **God of War: Ragnarök**.

## Notes

- made for [The Odin Project's Landing Page Project][1]
- since the challenge was to recreate the [base][2] [template][3] with only image references, my general procedure was as follows:
  1. look through the image a couple times, taking note of both the content and design
  2. recreate the dummy content, paying no heed to design other than grouping certain elements into classes I knew I would use later
  3. recreate the basic colors of each section
  4. work section by section and recreate the spacing, layout, and various styles
  5. review both content and design to make minor alterations / fixes to better reflect the template (commit 4f7cf30)
  6. go through section by section *again*, this time adding GoW content and replacing dummy content
  7. final check to make sure everything looks
